## üîç Condition System Details

### Supported Variables
Using PlaceholderAPI supported variables:

#### Player Attributes
```yaml
conditions:
  - "%player_level% >= 10"           # Level restriction
  - "%player_health% >= 15"          # Health restriction
  - "%player_food_level% >= 10"      # Hunger restriction
```

#### Economic Attributes
```yaml
conditions:
  - "%vault_eco_balance% >= 100"     # Balance restriction
  - "%vault_eco_balance_formatted% >= $1000"  # Formatted balance
```

#### Permission Checks
```yaml
conditions:
  - "%player_has_permission_teleportpack.vip% == yes"  # VIP permission check
```

### Condition Messages
```yaml
condition-messages:
  - "&cInsufficient level! Need at least level 10"
  - "&cInsufficient balance! Need at least 100 coins"
  - "&cVIP permission required!"
```

## üí° Economic Balance Strategies

### 1. Newbie Protection
```yaml
costs:
  tp:
    money: 0
    conditions:
      - "%player_level% <= 5"
  
  rtp:
    money: 0
    conditions:
      - "%player_level% <= 3"
```

### 2. Level-based Pricing
```yaml
# Use PlaceholderAPI to calculate dynamic pricing
# Cost = base cost * (level / 10)
conditions:
  - "cost = 50 * (%player_level% / 10)"
```

### 3. Member Discounts
```yaml
# 50% discount for VIP
conditions:
  - "cost = %player_has_permission_teleportpack.vip% ? original_cost * 0.5 : original_cost"
```

## üéÆ Practical Application Cases

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Economy Plugin Not Detected
**Issue**: "Vault not found, economy features disabled"
**Solution**: 
- Install Vault plugin

- Restart server

#### 2. Insufficient Balance but Teleportation Successful
**Issue**: Cost deduction failed
**Solution**:
- Check economy plugin configuration
- Confirm player has sufficient balance
- Check permission bypass settings

**Issue**: Cost displays as 0
**Solution**:
- Check configuration file format
- Confirm economic system is enabled
- Check PlaceholderAPI variables

# View economic variables
/papi parse me %vault_eco_balance%
```
